# Introduction

The script `run_analysis.R`performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

1. Downloading and unzipping dataset
2. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set using the `rbind()` function.
3. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 
5. Generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type. The output file is called `secTidy.txt`, and uploaded to this repository
